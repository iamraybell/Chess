# Design
1. Do not interfaces if the interface has only property getters.

# Coding style
We usually use the following coding style:
1. Class structure
- fields
- properties
- constructors
- factory methods
- public methods
- internal/private methods

2. No public fields. (unless the type is a struct with all public fields).

2. Spacing
Always add a blank line between methods, types etc.


# Some design considerations
## Interface vs. Abstract base class
If you could think of a basic functionality - abstract base class. If you could think of a class that implements more than one "concept" then the concept should be modeled with an interface.
